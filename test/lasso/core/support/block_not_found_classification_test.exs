defmodule Lasso.Core.Support.BlockNotFoundClassificationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Validates how "block not found" / "header not found" errors from various
  Ethereum clients are classified by the error pipeline.

  These errors occur when a provider is asked for a block it hasn't synced yet
  (slightly behind chain head). They should NOT penalize circuit breakers since
  the provider is healthy — it just hasn't seen that block.
